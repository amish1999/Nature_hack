In short, the basic idea is to optimize the electricity consumption based on a set of parameters(electricity slabs, pricing etc. specified in detail in pdf) for user to have a control over his consumption and provide him with a visual aid(web interface deashboard) to monitor his daily and monthly consumption activity and electricity bill.

Extensions:
1. Mainly we need to create an actuator which will change thermostat setting automatically based on the differences in actual and modelled consumption by converting energy to change in temperature setting of acs which will save that much energy
2. Make occupancy scheduling also real time by taking data from users google calender
